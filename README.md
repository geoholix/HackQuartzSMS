# HackQuartzSMS
Repository for SMS Dec '16 Quartz Hackathon Project
-	In 2015 alone 65.3 million individuals were forcibly displaced worldwide, with refugees representing 21.3 million of that total population. 
-	Europe specifically has experienced a dramatic increase in arrivals of refugees and currently hosts approximately 4.4 million individuals fleeing their homes.
-	We provide refugees with an easy non-threatening way to access provisionary care and other needed resources. 

-	In order to provide this service we built the app using the following methodology
-	Data design develop
-	Architecture and code

-	System of record, engagement, insight 
o	Record = dashboard and the s
o	Engagement = application
o	Insight = data returned and data displayed

-	With 441,900 asylum-seekers in 2015, Germany was the world’s largest recipient of individual applications worldwide; they also host the largest number of Syrian refugees outside the immediate area. 
-	Often, language is a barrier, so what we envision is this: a host city signs up to sponsor our app and posters are displayed around the city that feature a number to our app. The refugee sends a text with their current location and desired resource, such as “hospital, shelter, transit” and receives directions to the nearest location.
